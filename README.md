Artificial Language Learning Experiments
========================================

This repository contains materials for computer simulations of
artificial language learning experiments.

At the moment, it contains the code and data for my PWPL paper
demonstrating that baseline models explain participant behavior in the
Saffran 2001 study better than assuming they actually learned the
intended grammar.

sequences of length <= 5.
